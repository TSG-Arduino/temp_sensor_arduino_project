**Final project:** Temperature Sensor

The Temperature Sensor
----------------------

#### 

#### **Problem Statement:**

In order for the fish tank and hydroponic garden (located in AM103) to
be sustained, there are many working parts that must be maintained,
including the utilization of a temperature sensor. The temperature
sensor takes readings from the water of the fish tank, in order to
provide information to a lab technician as to whether the water is too
warm (a situation where either the water pump would need to be turned on
to get the water flowing and/or the grow light be turned off to allow
the water to cool down), or too cool (which any running pump would need
to be turned off, and/or the grow light turned on).

Our group has been tasked with analyzing and developing code in Arduino
and MATLAB, which interprets sensor data taken in voltage from a
thermistor, converts it to temperature, then uploads that data to an IoT
(Internet of Things) server. We must also be able to retrieve the
information for future utilization by other groups.

To accomplish the task, our group has analyzed the Arduino code from a
previous term, and made several adjustments to ensure that the code
functioned as it should. It was then tested and calibrated to ensure
that it sent correct data to the serial port. We then downloaded
previously written MATLAB code and modified it to allow for the
uploading of the data to the IoT (in this case, ThingSpeak.org). MATLAB
code was also written for the retrieval of the data, in a form that is
easy to interpret, and provides a plot of the data.

**Define Functions:**

**Clean Data Function**

function \[ clean\_data \] = clean\_data\_temp\_sensor( response,
data\_points )

%clean\_data\_temp\_sensor This function takes two inputs: a response
from thingspeak.com

%with a structure array and a number of data points also designated by
the user.

%It returns data that's been "cleaned" in a standard verticle matrix
that's easy to plot with.

% The url input requires a very specific structure to access the proper
data that is being

% filtered and cleaned.

% response =
webread('https://api.thingspeak.com/channels/318597/fields/1.json?results=5')

% data\_points = 5;

%

% clean\_data =

% 80.2900

% 78.5300

% 77.7400

% 82.2200

% 79.4800

clean\_data = zeros(1,data\_points)'; % initialize clean\_data matrix
with zeros filled up to num\_results input

for i = 1:data\_points % create for loop to write data points to
increasing indicies in clean\_data matrix

% set clean\_data indicies to a number created by str2num fucntion of
the url\_data structure

% array, by taking the structure array at the corresponding indice using
the field\_str variable

% to call the proper field

clean\_data(i) = str2num(response.feeds(i).field1);

end

end

**Plot Data Function**

function \[\] = plot\_data\_temp\_sensor( clean\_data )

%plot\_data\_temp\_sensor This function plots the inputted clean\_data
points versus

%the data point number.

%

% This function uses several check throughout to determine the best plot

% setup in varying input situations. For example, when only 1 input is

% requested, the format of the plot switches to points of marker size 14
so

% that the data actually shows on the graph. Also, the y limits of the
plot

% adapt to the range of the data, so when the range is 0, the plot
reverts

% to standard y limits.

%

% clean\_data is column vector of data

figure(1) % create figure window

% this if statement is required in the case of a user inputting only 1
data

% value, where the plot must show a dot at that point, in comparison to

% multiple data points where a simple line is used as coded in the else

% portion of the if statement

if numel(clean\_data) == 1

plot(clean\_data,'.','MarkerSize',14)

else

plot(clean\_data)

end

max\_data = round(max(clean\_data),4);% set max\_data to the rounded
max(clean\_data) to prevent comparison issues

min\_data = round(min(clean\_data),4);% set min\_data to the rounded
min(clean\_data) to prevent comparison issues

range = max\_data - min\_data; % calculate range by subtracting
max\_data from min\_data

max\_range = max\_data + .05 \* range; % set max\_range to 5% of range
added to max\_data

min\_range = min\_data - .05 \* range; % set min\_range to 5% of range
subtracted from min\_data

% an if statement is required to check for the case that the range would
be

% 0 and the limits of the y-axis would be impossible

% when the range is 0, standard ylim is used

if range ~= 0

ylim(\[min\_range, max\_range\])

end

% Additions to the graph for reference and identification

xlabel('Data Points'); % x-axis label

ylabel('Temperature (Fahrenheit)'); % y-axis label

title('Temperature'); % Inserts a title to the plot

grid; % Turns on grid

end

**User Input Function**

function \[ data\_points \] = user\_input\_temp\_sensor()

%user\_input\_temp\_sensor This function will validate the user input as
well

%as including error checking to ensure proper inputs are chosen.

%

% Function should be called in the command line like this:

% \*\* data\_points = user\_input\_temp\_sensor()\*\*

% ask the user for the number of data points they would like to see,

% ranging from 1 to 8000

data\_points = input('Enter the desired number of data points (1 to
8000): ');

% create while loop to check for approved number of points inputted and

% ask the user again for an approved number of points if out of range

while ~(data\_points &lt;= 8000 && data\_points &gt;= 1);

data\_points = input('Enter a positive integer less than or equal to
8000: ');

end

% inform user that a valid input was received.

disp(\[num2str(data\_points),' is Valid'\])

end

**Web API Function**

function \[ response \] = web\_api\_temp\_sensor( data\_points\_str )

%web\_api\_temp\_sensor This function pulls data string from the user
input in

%order to find specific data from thingspeak.

% This function will pull the data from the IoT on Thingspeak in order
to

% populate a matrix, based on user\_input, and output that matrix as

% response.

%

% Input: data\_points\_str =&gt; user input on the number of points we
want

% to receive in string format

%

% Output: response =&gt; json file with requested data

ThingSpeak\_channel = '318597';

thingSpeakReadURL = 'https://api.thingspeak.com/channels/';

field\_data = \[ThingSpeak\_channel,
'/fields/1.json?results=',data\_points\_str\];

url = \[thingSpeakReadURL field\_data\];

response = webread(url);

// Description: This arduino code takes voltage readings from a
thermistor, converts them to degrees Kelvin using Steinhart equation,

// then prints them to the serial port for reading by MATLAB

//

int thermistorPin = A0; // Initializes pin that the thermistor will be
connected to

double thermistorReading; // Initialize double thermistorReading for
storing thermistor values

double seriesResistor = 9720; // Value of the resistor used - measured
with multimeter

double thermistorNominal = 10790; // Resistance measured at 23.9 degrees
C

double temperatureNominal = 23.9; // Temperature for nominal resistance
value during calibration

double bCoefficient = 3950; // The beta coefficient of the termistor
(usually 3000-4000)

double steinhart; // Initialize double steinhart for calculating
Steinhart-Hart equation

double tempK; // Initialize double tempK for storing thermistor values
converted into Kelvin

double resistance; // Initialize double resistance for storing converted
thermistor value

String strTempK; // Initialize String strTempK for storing tempK value
as a string

void setup()

{

// put your setup code here, to run once:

Serial.begin(9600); // setup serial port to 9600 baud rate

}

void loop()

{

// use analogRead function to read thermistor input and store in
thermistorReading variable

// analogRead function samples at a max rate of 100 microseconds each

thermistorReading = analogRead(thermistorPin);

// convert raw thermistorReading into resistance

// this specific coding conversion comes from the thermistor supplier

resistance = 1023 / thermistorReading - 1;

resistance = seriesResistor / resistance;

// to convert the resistance to a voltage, we need to use the
Steinhart-Hart equation with

// simplified B term (due to lack of known variables)

// This equation is not exact but provides good data for the
temperatures that the thermistor

// is being used for.

// 1/T = 1/To + 1/B\*ln(R/Ro)

steinhart = resistance / thermistorNominal; // (R/Ro)

steinhart = log(steinhart); // ln(R/Ro)

steinhart /= bCoefficient; // 1/B \* ln(R/Ro)

steinhart += 1.0/(temperatureNominal + 273.15); // 1/To + 1/B \*
ln(R/Ro)

steinhart = 1.0 / steinhart; // invert

tempK = steinhart; // steinhart output is Kelvin

strTempK = String(tempK, 2); // convert tempK into a String with two
decimal places

Serial.println(strTempK); // print the Kelvin value

// wait 100 microsceonds or repeat 10x per second (change to modify
sampling rate)

delay(100);

#### **Results:**

The results of multiple tests on the system are that the code
successfully took readings, then sent them to the IoT, which was
successfully retrieved by a separate computer. We were able to do
multiple runs of sent data and retrieve that data at any time afterward.
The data was collected at approximately 20 second intervals, and
captured in degrees Fahrenheit.

We were able to make user prompts simple, and simplify and organize a
lot of the code which was given to us. There are certain spots in the
code that, if not entered correctly, do error and result in a breakdown
(such as the entering of the serial port number, as that port number
changes on any computer, and if not entered correctly, there is no
comparison to what it should be).

The data retrieval does plot a graph based of the number of data points
or amount of time specified by the user prompt, and the data taken. It
is always displayed as temperature vs time. The example of 300 points of
data collection in plot follows:

Issues:

-   Depending on status of the network in use, the state of the
    computer, and several other factors, data sometimes ended up not
    transmitting completely and the sending program needed to be re-run.

-   The calibration of the thermistor was accurate to about +/- 2.0
    degrees of the actual read temperature (taken via hand-held
    digital thermometer) at any given time. The delay in the sent data
    compared to the reading of the temperature could be a factor, but it
    is more likely due to the precision of calibration in which
    we completed. Two degrees is an acceptable variance, and can be
    recalibrated with the utilization of a more accurate thermistor or
    temperature sensor.

We were able to make user prompts simple, and simplify and organize a
lot of the code which was given to us. There are certain spots in the
code that, if not entered correctly, do error and result in a breakdown
(such as the entering of the serial port number, as that port number
changes on any computer, and if not entered correctly, there is no
comparison to what it should be).

The data retrieval does plot a graph based of the number of data points
or amount of time specified by the user prompt, and the data taken. It
is always displayed as temperature vs time. The example of 100 points of
data collection in plot follows:

#### **Future Work:**

A number of future modifications could be made to this project to better
utilize data, and make it more user friendly, such as:

-   Creating the ability to remotely upload data (being able to pull the
    temperatures using an Arduino and internet connection to transmit
    the data points when requested)

-   Temperature data gathering at regular intervals to gather trends of
    temperatures in the tank throughout the day, in order to establish
    routines of turning pumps on/off, lights on/off, or a heater on/off
    at regular times.

-   The integration of the data gathered from the temperature sensor
    with the data from other sensors to better establish trends of the
    ecosystem of the tank, and make adjustments.

-   Monitoring the change in temperature of the water when it is pumped
    into the plant boxes and after it has traveled back to the tank
    could give clues and a segment of data to lead to whether
    adjustments should be made for the method to be more effective.

-   Programming which automatically sends alerts or feedback based on
    certain conditions (e.g. trends, alerts, etc.)

-   Developing code to prompt for data retrieval for certain times of
    day, certain days; specified data from time periods which has been
    stored on the IoT server.

-   Utilization of a proper temperature sensor as opposed to a
    thermistor would yield more accurate results, more
    accurate calibration.
